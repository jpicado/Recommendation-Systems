# Recommendation system with implicit feedback

Jesse Steinweg-Woods wrote an excellent [introduction to recommendations systems with implicit feedback][Rec-System]. In his article, he provides the Python code to implement a recommendation system using the [Implicit][Implicit] library. However, the version used by Jesse is old and incompatible with the current version. This repository contains the code provided in the article, but updated to be compatible with the current version of the Implicit library.
